# Task 5: Database Integration

This project focuses on integrating a REST API with a database using SQL. You will learn the fundamentals of SQL and how to connect your API to a relational database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. The primary goal is to enable your API to store and retrieve user data, including their name, email, and age, by embedding SQL queries directly within your API endpoints.

## Project Overview

The core of this task involves:

*   **Learning Basic SQL:**  Understanding fundamental SQL commands for data manipulation and querying.
*   **Database Connection:**  Establishing a secure and reliable connection between your API server and a chosen database.
*   **API Integration:**  Modifying or creating API endpoints to interact with the database, performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data.

## Skills Developed

Upon completion of this task, practical experience gained:

*   **Basic SQL:**  Writing queries for data insertion, retrieval, update, and deletion.
*   **Database Connection:**  Implementing database connection logic in your application.
*   **API Integration:**  Seamlessly incorporating database operations into your API endpoints.
*   **Express Basics:**  Leveraging the Express.js framework for building your API.

## Getting Started

*(This section is a placeholder. You'll want to fill this in with specific instructions for setting up and running your project.)*

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
*   A database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) installed and running.
*   An existing Express.js API project (or instructions to create one).

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd task5-database-integration
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Database Setup:** 
    *   Configure your database connection details (e.g., in a `.env` file).
    *   Create the necessary database and tables. *(Provide SQL script or commands here if applicable)*

### Running the Application

1.  Start the API server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```
2.  *(Optionally, describe how to test the API endpoints, e.g., using Postman or `curl`)*

## Usage

*(Describe how users would interact with your API after it's running. For example:)*

*   **POST `/users`** : Create a new user.
*   **GET `/users`** : Retrieve a list of all users.
*   **GET `/users/:id`** : Retrieve a specific user by ID.
*   **PUT `/users/:id`** : Update a user's information.
*   **DELETE `/users/:id`** : Delete a user.
